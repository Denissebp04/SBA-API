# SBA-API

The purpose of this project was to measure our capability to implement advanced JavaScript tools and features in a 
practical manner. For this project we used asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.

For my project I created a random joke generator using a joke api. I used fetch instead of axios since I was getting
errors when using axios. I used DOM manipulation to make the button interactive and added a few animations.
